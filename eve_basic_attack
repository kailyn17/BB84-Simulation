# Eve Basic Attack
# Eve Basic Intercept-Resend Attack

This folder contains a simulation of the classic intercept-resend attack.

## Description
Eve intercepts each qubit sent by Alice, measures it using a randomly chosen basis, and resends the result to Bob. This causes inconsistencies in the final key, which can be detected by calculating the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER).

## Key Features
- Eve measures qubits using random bases
- Introduces errors in Bobâ€™s measurements
- QBER can be analyzed to detect eavesdropping
