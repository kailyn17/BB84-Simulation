# Basic BB84 Quantum Key Distribution

This folder contains the basic BB84 QKD simulation.

## Description
Alice and Bob each randomly generate a sequence of bits and bases. Alice sends qubits encoded in her bases, and Bob measures them in his. After basis reconciliation, they discard mismatched positions and form a shared secret key.

This version does not include any eavesdropper (Eve) and serves as a baseline for comparison.

## Key Features
- Random bit and basis generation
- Qubit transmission and measurement
- Basis matching and key extraction
